# Under Development

It is an awesome creation of cards and decks all wrapped up in a game.
We still don't know what the **** is going on in the game, but what we DO know is that even though we had 3 days to make it, it will be awesome.

One of the developers has chosen to keep the development alive after the project week ended.

##Installation
Download and play that shit. It's free, so **blaze away**!
You still have to compile the game by yourself. once it is somewhat playable we will release a compite version.
only requirment is that you have Java installed on you pc/laptop.

##Documentation
**DOCUMENTATION WILL BE GENERATED BY JAVADOC ONCE WE ARE DONE.
**Wiki should be free to be adited
